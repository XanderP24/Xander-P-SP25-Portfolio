            <h2>Midnight Snack</h2>
    <p> For this project, I chose to get a snack from the kitchen on a late night for my idea. I chose it because it is a moment I often find myself back it and I thought it would be funny to make it a story about it through audio. I combined 17 audio samples, 12 recorded by me and the others retrieved from freesound. I used effects such as amplify, reverb, and EQ to make sure that it sounds and flows well. This was done using Audacity.</p>
